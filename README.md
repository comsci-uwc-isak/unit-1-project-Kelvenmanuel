### Definition of the problem 
The company wants to create a new system that should provide them information about the car, how many kms the cars run, record, summary and history of their cars. This system should be better than the last one or a new one that come to improve the company and make the process easier for their workers. However, there are many factors that influence the system or the decision to use it.
	
Sometimes new systems can fail, if this happens the company can be damaged or loose data which will cost money and time. On the other hand, the new system can also be a source of income. For instance, if itâ€™s used efficiently, they can increase the value of their cars. When we decide to use a new system, we should consider all the outcomes for upmost efficiency.
